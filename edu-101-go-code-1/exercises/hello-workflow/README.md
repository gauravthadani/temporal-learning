# Exercise 1: Hello Workflow
During this exercise, you will
* Review the business logic of the provided Workflow Definition to understand its behavior
* Modify the Worker initialization code to specify a task queue name
* Run the Worker initialization code to start the Worker process
* Execute the Workflow from the command line, specifying your name as input

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for TODO 
comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to the code). 
If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at the complete version 
in the `solution` subdirectory.

## Part A: Review the Workflow Business Logic

1. Open the `greeting.go` file (located in the `practice` subdirectory) 
   in the editor
2. Review the input parameters, business logic, and return value. 

## Part B: Specify a Task Queue Name for the Worker

1. Open the `worker/main.go` file (located in the `practice` subdirectory) 
   in the editor
2. Specify `greeting-tasks` as the name of the task queue
3. Save your changes

## Part C1: Fetch the Dependencies

1. Open a terminal window in the environment and change to the 
   `practice` subdirectory for this exercise
2. Run the following command to download and install the Go packages 
   needed by the code, which will include the Temporal Go SDK

```
go mod tidy
```

## Part C2: Start the Worker

2. Run the following command in the terminal window to start the Worker

```
go run worker/main.go
```

## Part D: Start the Workflow from the Command Line

1. Open another terminal window in the environment and change to the 
   `practice` subdirectory for this exercise
2. Run the following command, replacing `Donna` with your own name. 
   Be sure to retain the same quoting shown here when you run the command:

```bash
temporal workflow start \
    --type GreetSomeone \
    --task-queue greeting-tasks \
    --workflow-id my-first-workflow \
    --input '"Donna"'
```

Note that this command starts the Workflow, but it does not wait for 
it to complete or show the result. 

If you have time, continue with the optional part of the exercise 
below to see how to use the `temporal` command to display the result.

## Part E (Optional): Display the Result
You can run the following command to display the result of a Workflow Execution: 

```bash
temporal workflow show --workflow-id my-first-workflow
```

It is also possible, and often more convenient, to view this information using the Web UI. You will 
have a chance to do this in the next exercise.


### This is the end of the exercise.
